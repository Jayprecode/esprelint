# Documentation

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), and also utilizes 
- [ESLint](https://github.com/BrindoSoft/Frontend-structure/edit/dev/README.md#eslint), 
- [Prettier](https://github.com/BrindoSoft/Frontend-structure/edit/dev/README.md#prettier), 
- [Husky](https://github.com/BrindoSoft/Frontend-structure/edit/dev/README.md#husky), 
- [Lintstage](https://github.com/BrindoSoft/Frontend-structure/edit/dev/README.md#lint-staged) 

and a pretty custom tweaked editor's configuration for vscode.

## Why?

The essence of the tools listed above implemented in this template, is applicable for the use of ensuring ```Good code practice (GCP)```

# Eslint

ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions:

- ESLint uses Espree for JavaScript parsing.
- ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code.
- ESLint is completely pluggable, every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime.

### Find Problems

ESLint statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. ESLint is built into most text editors and you can run ESLint as part of your continuous integration pipeline.

### Fix Automatically

Many problems ESLint finds can be automatically fixed. ESLint fixes are syntax-aware so you won't experience errors introduced by traditional find-and-replace algorithms.

### Customize

Preprocess code, use custom parsers, and write your own rules that work alongside ESLint's built-in rules. You can customize ESLint to work exactly the way you need it for your project.

For better understanding and configuration visit [Eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint)

<br />

# Prettier

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

Prettier can be run in your editor on-save, in a pre-commit hook, or in CI environments to ensure your codebase has a consistent style without devs ever having to post a nit-picky comment on a code review ever again!

# Husky

Husky improves your commits and more 🐶 woof!

### Install

```bash
npm install husky --save-dev
# or
yarn add husky --save-dev
```

### Usage

Edit ```package.json > prepare``` script and run it once:

```bash
npm set-script prepare "husky install"
npm run prepare
# or
yarn set-script prepare "husky install"
yarn prepare
```

Add a hook:

```bash
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm test"
git add .husky/pre-commit
```

Make a commit:

```bash
git commit -m "Keep calm and commit"
# `npm test` will run
```

For better understanding and configuration, read through the documentation provided by [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky)

# Lint-staged

Run linters against staged git files and don't let 💩 slip into your code base!

Linting makes more sense when run before committing your code. By doing so you can ensure no errors go into the repository and enforce code style. But running a lint process on a whole project is slow, and linting results can be irrelevant. Ultimately you only want to lint files that will be committed.

```bash
$ git commit

✔ Preparing lint-staged...
❯ Running tasks for staged files...
  ❯ packages/frontend/.lintstagedrc.json — 1 file
    ↓ *.js — no files [SKIPPED]
    ❯ *.{json,md} — 1 file
      ⠹ prettier --write
  ↓ packages/backend/.lintstagedrc.json — 2 files
    ❯ *.js — 2 files
      ⠼ eslint --fix
    ↓ *.{json,md} — no files [SKIPPED]

# Getting Started with Next

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the
file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on
[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in
`pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as
[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your
feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the
[Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme)
from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more
details.

# Example app with styled-components

This example features how you use a different styling solution than [styled-jsx](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx) that also supports universal styles. That means we can serve the required styles for the first render within the HTML and then load the rest in the client. In this case we are using [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components).

For this purpose we are extending the `<Document />` and injecting the server side rendered styles into the `<head>`, and also adding the `babel-plugin-styled-components` (which is required for server side rendering). Additionally we set up a global [theme](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#theming) for styled-components using NextJS custom [`<App>`](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app) component.

## How to use

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-styled-components with-styled-components-app
# or
yarn create next-app --example with-styled-components with-styled-components-app
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

### Try it on CodeSandbox

[Open this example on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-styled-components)

### Notes

When wrapping a [Link](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link) from `next/link` within a styled-component, the [as](https://styled-components.com/docs/api#as-polymorphic-prop) prop provided by `styled` will collide with the Link's `as` prop and cause styled-components to throw an `Invalid tag` error. To avoid this, you can either use the recommended [forwardedAs](https://styled-components.com/docs/api#forwardedas-prop) prop from styled-components or use a different named prop to pass to a `styled` Link.
